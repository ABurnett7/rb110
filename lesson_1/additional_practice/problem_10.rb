# Given the munsters hash below

#   "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
#   "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
# }

# Modify the hash such that each member of the Munster family has an additional "age_group" key 
# that has one of three values describing the age group the family member is in (kid, adult, or senior). 
# Your solution should produce the hash below

#   "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male", "age_group" => "kid" },
#   "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female", "age_group" => "adult" } }
